# ThreadBank: A Multi-threaded Banking Simulator 🏦

## 📌 Overview
ThreadBank is a Java application that simulates a concurrent banking system using multiple threads to handle client transactions, network operations, and server-side processing. The system demonstrates key concepts in concurrent programming including thread synchronization, buffer management, and client-server communication.

## 🏗️ Architecture
- **Multi-threaded Design**: Implements separate threads for network management, server operations, and client transactions
- **Buffer Management**: Features circular buffers for managing network I/O operations
- **Transaction Processing**: Handles multiple transaction types (DEPOSIT, WITHDRAW, QUERY) concurrently
- **File-based Storage**: Utilizes text files for account information and transaction records

## 🧩 Core Components
### Network (`Network.java`)
- Manages network communication
- Handles buffer operations
- Controls client-server connectivity

### Server (`Server.java`)
- Processes transactions
- Manages account operations
- Handles concurrent requests

### Client (`Client.java`)
- Sends transaction requests
- Receives transaction results
- Manages client-side operations

### Supporting Classes
- `Accounts.java`: Account structure and operations
- `Transactions.java`: Transaction data structure
- `Driver.java`: Main application entry point

## ⚙️ Technical Specifications
- **Language**: Java
- **Architecture**: Multi-threaded
- **Buffer Type**: Circular buffer
- **Storage**: File-based
- **Thread Types**: Network, Server, Client (Sender/Receiver)

## 🛠️ Configuration
| Parameter | Value | Description |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| Buffer Size | 10 packets | Configurable for performance |
| Max Accounts | 100 | Maximum number of accounts |
| Max Transactions | 100 | Maximum pending transactions |

## 📊 Performance
The system's performance can be optimized by adjusting the buffer size. Current settings:
- Default buffer size: 10 packets
- Larger buffer = More simultaneous transactions
- Trade-off between memory usage and throughput

## 🚀 Getting Started
1. Clone the repository
2. Compile all Java files
3. Run Driver.java
4. Monitor transaction processing through console output

## 📝 Usage Example
```java
Network objNetwork = new Network("network");
objNetwork.start();

Server objServer = new Server();
objServer.start();

Client send = new Client("sending");
Client receive = new Client("receiving");

Key tips for README organization:
1. Use emojis sparingly for visual hierarchy
2. Create clear sections with descriptive headers
3. Use tables for structured data
4. Include code blocks for examples
5. Add a directory tree for file structure
6. Use consistent formatting throughout
7. Make important information easily scannable

You can edit this in any text editor and GitHub will render the Markdown formatting. Would you like me to explain any specific formatting elements or help you modify any section?
